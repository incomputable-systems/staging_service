## Documentation

Full system description and usage examples are available at:
https://incomputablestagingservice.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

## Code

Generally, the `master` branch reflects the release published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/incomputable.staging_service/), and is
considered stable: it should work 'out of the box' for the supported backends.
For a list of supported backends, please refer to the documentation.

The `devel` branch (and any branch other than master) may not correspond to the
published documentation and, specifically, may have dependencies which need to
be resolved manually.
